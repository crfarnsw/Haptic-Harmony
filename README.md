Group Member Names: Jesse Emelian; Caleb Farnsworth; Yousif Alawsachi; Nick Dutcher; Jeremy Dion

Project Summary: The video game market has grown dramatically over the past couple decades and while there are more people gaming than ever, there are still gamers who are feeling left out. Our project seeks to create a rhythm game which creates a chart from user selected music and generates a playable level with easily distinguishable visual and haptic feedback. Allowing players with a varying degree of visual disability to enjoy games.

We integrated Jesse Keoghâ€™s beat mapping algorithm to generate the notes for our levels. Much thanks to Jesse Keogh for his excellent in-depth explanation on how to algorithmically map beats using Unity. Without his insight and hard work, the beat mapping portion of the project would not have been possible.
